## takeaway
The most common salary negotiation mistake? Not negotiating at all.

## content - straw man quotes
* I enjoy my job, I don't work for the money (aka I don't need to negotiate)
	- work is better when you don't need the money
    - would you work if you didn't get any money?

* If I negotiate, I may not get the job
	- change your mindset, they are professionals
		- it's not about making friends, this is a business negotiation
		- they've done this hundreds of times
		- they may think less of you for NOT negotiating
	- from "i am at their mercy"
        -> to "they want you", "you offer them value"

* I don't deserve to earn so much
	1. you are better than you think
		- many people can't fizzbuzz < and they are alreadys employed as devs!
		- don't be modest (quality here is comparable to silicon valley)
	2. they have invested effort in finding you
        - e.g. amazon, pricey to find the right person
		- see things from their perspective (they want you)

* I don't know how to negotiate
	- 1. research and prepare
        - know your numbers
        - practise
	- 2. negotiate delayed
        - at home, via email
        - "let me think about it", "i need to ask my significant other"
	- 3. don't answer: how much do you want to earn (or how much you are earning now)
		- "what is your prev. salary" is employer-speak for "please give me a reason to pay you less"
	- other: be willing to walk away; get equity (and other perks)

* I am not allowed to talk about my salary
	- story "mit der gehaltserhöhung würdest du mehr verdienen als alle anderen kollegen."
	- my salary history (see below)
        - They will pay me what is fair
